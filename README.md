# Auto Slide Tracker

## Project Overview
This project is a feature for an existing chatbot, developed as part of a bachelor's thesis. It aims to provide automated timestamp recognition for slide transitions in lectures, helping to track when each slide was discussed.

## Relation to the Main Project
SlideDetector is designed to work alongside Chatbot Repository. It will be developed as a separate module and later integrated into the chatbot system.

## Objective
* Detect when a slide transition occurs during a lecture.

* Record timestamps for each slide discussion.

* Provide structured data for further analysis and reference.

## Installation & Setup
Since the project is still under development, detailed installation instructions will be provided at a later stage.
